#summary Description of supported diff formats.

= Introduction =

I will describe which formats of letter is supported by the extension and what problem you might experience with them.

= Generic SVN mailer formar =

This is most common format of letters that sent by SVN mailers. It usually looks like this

It's easy to parse and you shouldn't have any problems with that. Note however that almost all the other formats looks generally the same but with minor differences that makes them harder to parse. So even if you can't see the difference it still might be there preventing extension from working correctly.

Nothing too exciting. I have no idea how new and binary files might look here, so they can  break the parser. If that is the case just mail me broken letter and it's going to be fixed in the next version.
